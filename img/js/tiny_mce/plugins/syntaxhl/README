SyntaxHL is a plugin for the Tinymce (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) javascript WYSIWYG editor allowing you to insert highlighted code into the editor. The syntax highlighting is done using Syntax Highligher (http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) and the plugin simply produces the right syntax for this.

== Installation

= Move to plugin directory

Copy the syntaxhl folder into the Tinymce plugin directory so the path is something like this:

/path/to/tinymce/plugins/syntaxhl

= Configure Tinymce

In your HTML under the tinymce.init option you need to append or add the line to load the plugin. You also need to add the button 'syntaxhl' to one of the button lines.

Example configuration:

tinyMCE.init({ 
	theme : "advanced", 
	plugins : "syntaxhl", 
	theme_advanced_buttons1 : "bold,italic,underline,undo,redo,link,unlink,image,forecolor,styleselect,removeformat,cleanup,code, syntaxhl",
	theme_advanced_buttons2 : "", 
	theme_advanced_buttons3 : "", 
	remove_linebreaks : false, 
	extended_valid_elements : "textarea[cols|rows|disabled|name|readonly|class]" 
});


That should be all you need to get the plugin working. Open up the editor and check the button has appeared (looks like a highlighter pen).
